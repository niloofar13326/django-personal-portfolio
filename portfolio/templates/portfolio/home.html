    <h1 id="hometext" class="font-weight-bold">Greetings! I am Niloofar</h1>
    <p> I am niloofar and in my thirties. Having done my Bs in Electrical engineering, Electronics, I gained my Ms in this amazing and reputed field of study. After working as a university lecturer, I have decisively decided to make my childhood dream true. Since I used and had done some software programming related to electrical engineering, namely AVR, PLC, and Proteus PCB Design Software, I have started to study and experienced programming. Having gained some hands-on experience in Python, HTML, CSS and Django, I have recently been studying and practicing javascripts. 
        I have been certified by University of Michigan which is offered by coursera in Python, and also Iran Technical & Vocational Training Organization in HTML and CSS. I believe if I am given this opportunity to work, I am certainly sure that my hiring manager and employers will be satisfied with my job. My former colleagues, professors, and employers have been believed that I make a good teamwork and the same time a fantastic problem solver. I think I am able to tackle difficult situations and help my colleagues when I am needed, and as a resilient person, I never give up learning and improving.
